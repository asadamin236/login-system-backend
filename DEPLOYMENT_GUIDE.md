# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed
The deployment was using mock endpoints instead of connecting to the real database. This has been fixed by updating the serverless functions to use the actual database controllers when environment variables are available.

## Required Environment Variables

To enable database functionality in your Vercel deployment, you need to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### Database Configuration
```
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-username  
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
```

## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project: `login-system-backend-gamma`
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add each variable with the following format:
   - **Name**: `DB_HOST`
   - **Value**: `your-actual-database-host`
   - **Environment**: Select `Production`, `Preview`, and `Development`

## Database Setup

Make sure your database is accessible from Vercel's servers:
- Use a cloud database service (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Ensure the database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges
- Create the database and tables (the app will auto-create tables if they don't exist)

## Testing the Deployment

After setting environment variables:

1. **Check API Status**: Visit `https://login-system-backend-gamma.vercel.app/`
   - Should show `"mode": "database"` if environment variables are set
   - Should show `"mode": "mock"` if environment variables are missing

2. **Test Registration**: POST to `/api/auth/register`
   ```json
   {
     "username": "testuser",
     "email": "test@example.com", 
     "password": "password123"
   }
   ```

3. **Test Login**: POST to `/api/auth/login`
   ```json
   {
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "password123"
   }
   ```

## What Was Changed

1. **Fixed Module System Compatibility**: Converted all serverless functions from ES modules (`export default`) to CommonJS (`module.exports`) to match the project configuration
2. **Created Serverless Database Utilities**: Added `utils/serverlessDb.js` for optimized database connections in serverless environment
3. **Created JWT Utilities**: Added `utils/jwtUtils.js` for proper JWT token generation (now uses real JWT tokens instead of mock strings)
4. **Created Serverless Auth**: Added `utils/serverlessAuth.js` with simplified registration and login functions optimized for serverless
5. **Updated `/api/auth/register.js`**: Now uses serverless-optimized database utilities and generates real JWT tokens
6. **Updated `/api/auth/login.js`**: Now uses serverless-optimized database utilities and generates real JWT tokens
7. **Updated `/api/index.js`**: Main API handler with proper module loading and error handling
8. **Updated `vercel.json`**: Better routing configuration and function timeouts for database operations

## Fallback Behavior

If database environment variables are not set:
- The API will run in "mock mode" 
- Registration and login will work but won't persist data
- Responses will include "(MOCK MODE)" in the message
- This allows the API to work for demo purposes without database setup

## Next Steps

1. Set up your database environment variables in Vercel
2. Redeploy or wait for automatic deployment
3. Test the endpoints to confirm database connectivity
4. Users created via the deployment will now be stored in your actual database
